/**
 * Letter reveal for the word being recited: a soft ink wash sweeps across the
 * glyphs (right-to-left for Arabic), so each letter breathes in to full ink
 * in turn. [progress] is 0..1 across the word and is read only at draw time —
 * the sweep animates every frame without a single recomposition or relayout.
 *
 * The wash is painterly rather than mechanical: across the feathered edge the
 * alpha follows a smootherstep curve (zero slope at both ends), so ink blooms
 * in with a soft toe and settles with a soft shoulder — a wash drawn onto
 * paper, not a wipe. The edge itself is wide, about half the word.
 *
 * Letters ahead of the wash rest at [restingAlpha] (the "upcoming" ink);
 * letters behind it are fully inked. The mask uses a small bleed around the
 * measured text box so Arabic glyphs that overhang their bounds are not clipped
 * while the offscreen wash is active. The layer is local to this word's draw
 * scope — it never paints onto neighbouring words.

/**
 * One word-local bloom inside a larger shaped [Text] (Arabic-only / no-gloss).
 *
 * Constraints that ruled out earlier approaches:
 * - Per-glyph [SpanStyle]s flip Uthmanic Hafs joining (#133).
 * - A separate overlay [Text] of one word re-shapes in isolation (no fade).
 * - [drawText] with a [Color] argument does **not** override existing
 *   [SpanStyle] colours — painting over a transparent active span stays
 *   invisible until the word becomes recited.
 * - Inflated paper/orange rects bleed onto neighbours.
 * - Baking "upcoming" into span colours, or animating upcoming dim from 0,
 *   flashes the whole ayah full-ink when playback lands on it. Upcoming dim
 *   is a full-strength draw-phase cover from the first Upcoming frame.
 *
 * So every bloom operates on the ayah's already-shaped [TextLayoutResult],
 * clipped to [TextLayoutResult.getPathForRange]:
 * - [UpcomingDim]: static paper cover (padded horizontally beyond the
 *   selection box, but confined to its line so it cannot wash adjacent text).
 * - [InkReveal]: paper coverage of `1 − glyphAlpha` along the wash curve
 *   (same pad as UpcomingDim).
 * - [ColorReveal]: re-draw shaped glyphs, [BlendMode.SrcIn]-tint orange,
 *   then apply the [letterFadeIn] DstIn wash.
