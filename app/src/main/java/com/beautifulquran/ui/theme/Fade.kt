/**
 * Softly dissolves the content at its top and bottom edges, so scrolling
 * feels like ink fading off a single sheet of paper.
 *
 * Implementation note: because every sheet sits on a solid paper color, the
 * fade is drawn as a cheap gradient overlay of that color on top of the
 * content. This costs one rect per edge in the draw phase — no offscreen
 * compositing layer, no alpha mask — which keeps scrolling at the display's
 * native refresh rate even on modest GPUs.

/**
 * Letter reveal for the word being recited: a soft ink wash sweeps across the
 * glyphs (right-to-left for Arabic), so each letter breathes in to full ink
 * in turn. [progress] is 0..1 across the word and is read only at draw time —
 * the sweep animates every frame without a single recomposition or relayout.
 *
 * The wash is painterly rather than mechanical: across the feathered edge the
 * alpha follows a smootherstep curve (zero slope at both ends), so ink blooms
 * in with a soft toe and settles with a soft shoulder — a wash drawn onto
 * paper, not a wipe. The edge itself is wide, about half the word.
 *
 * Letters ahead of the wash rest at [restingAlpha] (the "upcoming" ink);
 * letters behind it are fully inked. The offscreen layer this needs is only
 * the size of one word, and the modifier should only be attached while the
 * word is active.
