/**
 * The reader's single source of truth for *how a word's ink should behave*.
 *
 * Sits between [com.beautifulquran.domain.HighlightEngine] (pure recitation
 * timing: which word is lit, repeat/high-water facts) and the mode-specific
 * renderers in ReaderComponents.kt (how Arabic gloss, English, and Arabic-only
 * Hafs actually draw text). Every visual highlight decision routes through
 * here so the effect can be tuned in one place; the renderers consume
 * [InkEngine.Word] and never re-derive highlight semantics themselves.
 * See docs/INK_ENGINE.md.
 *
 * The word-policy core is deliberately pure — no Compose types in any
 * decision function — so it unit-tests on the JVM the same way
 * [com.beautifulquran.domain.HighlightEngine] and
 * [com.beautifulquran.ui.reader.focus.FocusEngine] do. The one Compose
 * dependency is [tuning] being snapshot-backed, so the developer-mode Ink Lab
 * can retune the feel live and every open animation picks the change up.
 *
 * What stays out (see the non-goals in docs/INK_ENGINE.md): scroll focus
 * (FocusEngine), timing lookup (HighlightEngine), Arabic shaping and draw
 * primitives (ui/theme/Fade.kt), and layout (the reader composables).
