/**
 * Route-based output-latency presets for the karaoke clock.
 *
 * [HighlightEngine] is pure: it answers "which word at time *t*?". Bluetooth
 * (and similar) delay is a property of the *playback path*, not of the
 * segments — so the reader subtracts a small offset from
 * `player.positionMs` before [HighlightClock] / [HighlightEngine] see it.
 *
 * Android never exposes a reliable end-to-end "ms until the ear" number for
 * A2DP. These presets are intentionally coarse: good enough that ink lands
 * with the voice on typical headsets, without baking lag into timing data or
 * the engine. A later user nudge can sit on top if needed.
