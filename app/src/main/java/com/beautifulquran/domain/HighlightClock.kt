/**
 * Smooths the player's raw position samples into the clock the word
 * highlight reads.
 *
 * `MediaController.currentPosition` is an estimate extrapolated from the
 * session's last update, so two consecutive polls can step *backward* by a
 * few dozen milliseconds when a fresh update lands. When such a step crosses
 * a word-segment boundary, the active word bounces back to the previous word
 * for one 33 ms tick and then forward again. The renderer treats that bounce
 * as a real re-activation and restarts the word's reveal — the word flashes
 * full ink, drops to the faint upcoming floor, then sweeps in again. Because
 * it needs a poll tick, an update arrival, and a word boundary to line up,
 * it strikes random words at random times.
 *
 * After a seek or media-item handoff the estimate is worse still: the first
 * samples can overshoot by hundreds of milliseconds and then snap back. That
 * lands on word 2 or 3, starts its ink wash, then bounces to an earlier word
 * and re-enters — a full reset of the sweep. With tajweed pacing the wash is
 * parked mid-letter on a hold, so the same bounce is obvious instead of
 * silent (the plain sweep has usually already reached full ink).
 *
 * The clock therefore:
 * - never moves backward within one [key] for small regressions (jitter)
 * - after a key change, [acceptNextSample], or a large accepted seek, enters a
 *   short **settle** window that holds *all* regressions and ignores
 *   implausible forward jumps, so post-seek corrections cannot bounce the word
 * - still accepts a large backward step outside settle as a genuine seek
 *   (loop restart, scrub) and re-arms settle
