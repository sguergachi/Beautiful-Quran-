/**
 * Letter-level pacing of the active word's ink sweep, derived from tajweed
 * rules (docs/TAJWEED_PACING.md).
 *
 * The word-level timing measures how long the reciter dwelled on the word;
 * tajweed says *where inside that word* the time is being spent. This object
 * turns a word's Hafs Uthmani text (which carries every needed mark: shadda,
 * maddah, dagger alef, sukūn, hamzat wasl, quiescent zero) into a monotone
 * time → wash-position [Curve].
 *
 * **The model is a gated hint, not a redistribution.** Word timings are
 * contiguous — 99.8 % of segments end exactly where the next begins — so there
 * is no slack inside a word: every count handed to a madd is taken from its
 * neighbours, which then run *faster* than the plain sweep. Spreading every
 * letter by its raw counts therefore made most of each word quicker and
 * sharper, losing the whole-word breath the reveal is built around. Instead:
 *
 * - **Gate** — a word is paced only if it holds a genuinely dramatic letter
 *   ([Hold]). Everything else returns null and takes the plain sweep, so the
 *   page reads exactly as it does today almost everywhere.
 * - **Cruise** — ordinary letters move at one constant speed, capped at
 *   [Hold.cruiseCap] times the plain rate. At a cap of 1 they are untouched.
 * - **Hold** — the freed time parks the wash on the held letter, creeping
 *   ([Hold.creep]) rather than freezing so the bloom stays alive.
 * - **Waqf** — an ayah's final word is held about 2.9× longer than a mid-ayah
 *   word (median 2983 ms vs 1040 ms). That slack is real rather than
 *   borrowed, so it is budgeted separately ([Hold.waqfShare]) and spent on the
 *   closing letter — the madd ʿāriḍ the reciter is actually sustaining.
 * - **Wasl connect** — when the previous word ends in nūn sākinah or tanwīn
 *   and this word starts with an idghām / iqlāb / ikhfāʾ letter, the nūn is
 *   absorbed and the reciter sustains the **opening letter of this word**.
 *   Pass the previous word as [prevArabic]. The previous word can pass
 *   [nextArabic] so its trailing nūn exits early (absorbed, not settled).
 * - **Waqf share scale** — short ayah-final words cap how much of
 *   [Hold.waqfShare] they may spend, so a high slider does not sprint the
 *   run-up on a three-letter closer.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin over immutable data, like [HighlightEngine] — no Android or
 * Compose dependencies, unit-tested on the JVM. The counts are murattal
 * heuristics (see the doc for calibration plans); letter widths are uniform
 * per letter in v1, which the wide feathered wash edge absorbs.
