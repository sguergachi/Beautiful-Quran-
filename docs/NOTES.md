# Verse notes (ḥawāshī)

A reader's own writing on the page: a short note attached to one verse, kept
in the margin of the sheet it belongs to. This is the app's third piece of
user data, after settings and bookmarks.

**Status: built on Android; web port pending.** Sections marked *Not yet built*
are spec, not description — everything else describes shipped behaviour.

## Why it exists, and what it is not

A mushaf that has been *studied* carries a hand in the margin — a scholar's
**ḥāshiya**: smaller script than the text, keyed to a spot on the page by a
tiny mark, written around the āyāt and never through them. That is exactly
the feature, and the tradition also fixes what it must not become.

It is **not** a comment box, a card, a bottom sheet, a "my notes" app, or a
second document parallel to the Quran. There is no title, no tag, no folder,
no rich text, no formatting bar. A note is a few sentences in the reader's
own hand, and it lives beside the verse that provoked it.

It is also not a translation or a tafsir. The app ships one voice for the
scripture and its gloss; the note is visibly, typographically the *reader's*
voice, and the two must never be confusable.

## The three commitments

1. **A note is a line in the page.** It is composed inside `AyahBlock`, below
   the translation, on the same inner reading spine. Nothing floats, nothing
   is layered, nothing expands a container. (DESIGN.md, "The sheet".)
2. **The margin lane is the reader's own ink.** The bookmark ribbon already
   owns the margin opposite the ayah selector. Notes join that lane rather
   than claiming the other side, so one edge of the sheet holds everything
   the reader put there and the other stays navigation.
3. **Writing happens on the verse, in place.** The note is composed at the
   exact position it will permanently occupy. No editor surface, no separate
   screen, no "save" step.

## Reading a note

| State | What is on the page |
|---|---|
| Verse has no note | Nothing. The margin lane shows only the ribbon tip. |
| Verse has a note | A small ruby **ḥāshiya tick** in the margin lane, and the note text below the verse's translation. |
| Note is long | The text truncates to three lines with a quiet ink ellipsis; tapping the note opens it in place (see "Writing"). |
| Another ayah is reciting | The tick vanishes with the rest of the chrome; the text recesses to upcoming ink with its verse, exactly like the translation. |

**Type.** **Cormorant Garamond Italic at weight 500**, 16 sp / 23 sp, 62 % ink,
on the inner spine, 12 dp/px below the translation. No quotation marks, no
"Note:" label, no attribution — the hand says it.

The face is the point. Italic alone is not enough: setting the note in the
app's *own* EB Garamond italic reads as **emphasis**, the same voice leaning,
because it is literally the same typeface as the translation above it.
Cormorant's italic is a genuinely different hand — looser `a` and `e`,
calligraphic `f` and `y`, higher stroke contrast, a wider pen — so the eye
reads a second person on the page rather than the app raising its voice. It is
also the historically right one: chancery cursive is what scribes actually
wrote ḥawāshī in, and what italic type was first cut from.

Two constraints make it work at reading size. Cormorant is a display face and
goes wispy small, so the note uses **weight 500** (a static instance cut from
the variable font, subset to latin + latin-ext at 132 KB) and sits a step
larger than the old EB italic at 16 sp with 0.15 sp letterspacing. Ink stays
**below** the translation's 66 % so the reader's own hand can never out-ink the
scripture it hangs off. This is a narrow, recorded exception to Cormorant's
display-only rule in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) — do not generalise it to body copy.

**The tick.** A short ruby stroke in the margin lane, optically inside the
ribbon's 44 dp/px target lane but never widening it, sitting below the
ribbon tip. Ruby because a note is the reader's mark, the same family as the
bookmark ribbon, and ruby is walled off from gold (ornament) and green
(action) precisely so "my marks" reads as neither. (DESIGN.md, "Color".)

**Arrival** *(not yet built)*. A note that has just been written should fade in
word by word with the lyric fade — the ink literally arriving on the page. A
note already on the page when the verse scrolls into view is simply there; the
fade is for the moment of writing, not for every appearance.

## Writing a note

**Entry: long-press the gold ayah mark `﴿٧﴾`.** The note belongs to the
verse, and the ayah mark *is* the verse's identity on the page. The gesture
is unclaimed: word tap seeks, word long-press opens the [Root
Viewer](ROOT_VIEWER.md), a margin tap toggles the bookmark. Long-pressing an
existing note's text opens the same editor on that note.

The mark is not a separate control in any reading mode: it is part of the shaped
ayah line in Arabic-only and English modes, so the shared `wordTapTarget`
resolves a long-press against the mark's glyph range **before** falling through
to the word under the finger (which opens the Root Viewer). In gloss mode the
mark is its own `ArabicAyahNumberUnit`, which takes the gesture directly.

Then, in place:

1. A caret appears on the note line beneath the verse, at exactly the
   position the finished note will occupy, and the keyboard rises.
2. The reader writes. The line grows downward; the verse above never moves.
   Playback, if running, is **not** interrupted.
3. Tapping anywhere off the note, opening another verse's note, or leaving
   the sheet **commits**. There is no OK, no Save, no Cancel — paper has none
   of them, and an autosaved note cannot be lost to a mis-tap.
4. Committing an empty (or whitespace-only) note deletes it; its tick
   retracts and the line closes.

The draft is `rememberSaveable` and carries its own `(surah, ayah)`, so it
survives rotation and process death and can never commit onto whichever verse
happens to be loaded when it lands. Opening a second note commits the first
*before* switching, and the stale focus-loss that follows is ignored by an
identity guard — otherwise one verse's text writes itself onto another.

*Not yet built:* the doc's original step 1, recessing the rest of the page to
upcoming ink while composing. The editor currently opens without dimming its
neighbours.

Deleting an existing note is therefore just: open it, clear it, tap away.
There is no separate destructive control and no confirmation — the reader
watched their own text leave the page.

**Hard rules.** No dialog, no bottom sheet, no ink bleed, no ripple. The
cursor is a caret in the paper, not a text field: no box, no underline, no
placeholder chrome. A single quiet placeholder in faint italic ink is
allowed on an empty note and must read as an invitation, not a label.

## What a note is *not* attached to

Verse-level only, for now. A word-level note is tempting, but the word is
already owned by the Root Viewer, and keying a note to a word requires a
manuscript-style reference mark above the line that phone type sizes cannot
carry legibly. Revisit only with a real reading problem to solve.

A note does **not** imply a bookmark. The ribbon means *return here*; the
note means *I wrote here*. They are different questions and a reader who
annotates ten verses in a sitting does not want ten ribbons. The ayah
selector rail keeps its ruby bars for bookmarks only; noted verses are not
marked on the rail.

## Where notes are read back

Notes surface in the existing **Bookmarks** sheet, not a fifth sheet. The
paper stack stays four sheets wide (DESIGN.md, "The sheet"), and the index is
already the app's answer to "what did I mark".

- A bookmarked verse that also carries a note shows the note as one italic
  line beneath its translation, truncated to two lines, on the index's inner
  40 dp/px spine.
- Tapping the entry returns to the verse in the reader, as it does today.

*Not yet built:*

- A verse with a note but **no** bookmark does not yet appear in the index, so
  an unbookmarked note is currently reachable only in the reader. This is the
  most important remaining gap.
- Index search does not match note text (only reference, chapter name, and
  verse text).

The header stays title + return only; no counts.

## Data

`data/NoteRepository.kt`, mirroring `BookmarkRepository`'s shape: a single
`StateFlow` the UI observes, its own `SharedPreferences` store, never
`quran.db` (which is read-only and versioned — invariant #1).

The bookmark store's `"surah:ayah:createdAt"` string-set encoding cannot
carry free text: notes contain colons, newlines, and emoji. Notes therefore
use **one preferences key per note**:

```
key:   "note:<surahId>:<ayah>"
value: the note text, verbatim
```

Keys are enumerated from `prefs.all` on load and parsed tolerantly — one
malformed key must never crash the reader (same rule as `Bookmark.decode`,
and covered by `NoteRepositoryTest`). No JSON, no Room, no serialization
dependency (invariant #5).

`Note(surahId, ayah, text)` is the model. The repository exposes
`notes: StateFlow<List<Note>>` in reading order, `noteFor(surahId, ayah)`,
and `write(surahId, ayah, text)` where blank text removes the entry.

There is deliberately **no** `updatedAt`. Bookmarks carry one because a future
recents view was specified for them; nothing orders notes by time, and an
unused timestamp is a field that has to be kept correct forever for no reader.

**Scale.** SharedPreferences loads the whole file into memory at first
access. A few thousand short notes is well inside that budget; if the store
ever needs to grow past that, it becomes a small writable SQLite file of its
own and never a table inside the bundled asset.

## Export *(not yet built)*

Notes are the only user data with no recovery path: the app is offline-first
with no accounts and no backend (invariant #6), so a lost device is a lost
hand. This is the highest-priority follow-up.

Settings → a quiet *Export notes* line writes a plain-text file through the
system document picker (SAF — no storage permission, no share sheet
required):

```
2:255 — Al-Baqarah
    the reader's note text, verbatim

7:31 — Al-A'raf
    …
```

Plain text, reading order, human-readable first and machine-parseable
second. Import is deliberately out of scope for v1; restoring is a manual
read, which is honest about what the format is.

## Web parity *(not yet built)*

Android shipped first; the web port is outstanding and the two must end up
feeling like one product (invariant #7's spirit). The web port stores notes in the same shape under
`localStorage`, keyed identically, alongside `web/src/data/settings.ts`. The
margin tick reuses the web `VerseBookmarkRibbon` lane, and the note line uses
the same italic EB Garamond at the reader's measure. The in-place editor is a
`contenteditable` line styled to nothing — no border, no background, no
resize handle.

## Open questions

1. **Entry gesture discoverability.** Long-pressing the ayah mark is unclaimed
   and semantically right, but nothing on the page advertises it. The
   alternative is a ruby qalam nib on the focused verse's margin lane —
   discoverable, but a second permanent affordance in a lane meant to stay
   quiet. Unresolved; the current build ships the hidden gesture.
2. **Long notes on a phone.** In-place composition is the truest reading of the
   metaphor, but a 400-word note pushes the verse off-screen while writing.
   If that proves bad in the hand, the fallback is an ink bleed from the ayah
   mark onto a writing sheet (the [Root Viewer](ROOT_VIEWER.md) primitive) —
   proven code, one step further from the margin.
3. **Notes during recitation.** The note line recesses with its verse, and
   entering the editor does not pause playback. Whether a reader actually wants
   to write *while* listening needs testing with real use.
