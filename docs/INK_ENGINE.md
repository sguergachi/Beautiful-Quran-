# InkEngine

The design (and now implementation) that unifies the reader's word-by-word
visual effect without turning it into a custom text renderer.

**Status: implemented.** The policy layer lives in
`app/src/main/java/com/beautifulquran/ui/reader/InkEngine.kt`; see
"As implemented" at the end of this document for what shipped and how the
developer-mode Ink Lab exposes the tuning live. The sections between here and
there are the original proposal, kept as the design record.

## Goal

Make the highlight look easy to polish across Arabic, English, and Arabic-only
Hafs modes while keeping the codebase thin.

The desired composition is:

```text
Focus engine      -> which ayah has the reader's attention
HighlightEngine   -> which word the reciter is on
InkEngine         -> how each word's ink should behave
Renderers         -> how each mode draws text safely
```

Each layer should return simple data to the next layer. None of the engines
should own more than one job.

## Current tension

The current system has the right major pieces:

- `FocusEngine` owns verse placement and scroll focus.
- `HighlightEngine` owns audio timing, active word lookup, repeat detection,
  and high-water state.
- Reader composables draw Arabic, English, and Arabic-only text.

The problem is that renderers also know too much about visual highlight policy:
upcoming alpha, active/recited state, repeat-chain participation, sweep timing,
secondary-line fade, and ayah mark fade are related decisions but are spread
through the reader UI.

That makes the effect harder to tune. A small polish change can require hunting
through multiple rendering paths.

## Proposed answer

Add one small reader-ui layer:

```text
app/src/main/java/com/beautifulquran/ui/reader/InkEngine.kt
```

`InkEngine` should be the single place that converts focus + highlight timing
into per-word visual behavior.

It should answer:

> Given this word, the active word, and whether this ayah is focused, how should
> the word's ink behave?

A deliberately small shape:

```kotlin
object InkEngine {
    enum class State {
        Plain,
        Upcoming,
        Active,
        Recited,
    }

    data class Word(
        val state: State,
        val repeat: Boolean,
    )

    fun word(
        position: Int,
        activeWord: ActiveWord?,
        isActiveAyah: Boolean,
        dimmed: Boolean,
    ): Word

    fun sweepMs(
        activeWord: ActiveWord?,
        playbackSpeed: Float,
    ): Int?
}
```

The exact names can change during implementation, but the shape should stay
small: one object, one word state, one word result, a few helper functions.

## Composition

### Focus engine

Owns ayah-level attention:

- focused ayah
- dimmed ayah
- programmatic scroll/follow behavior
- verse geometry and placement

It should not know about word alpha, repeat wash, or text masks.

### HighlightEngine

Owns recitation timing:

- active word lookup
- active segment duration
- repeat-aware backtracking
- high-water position
- repeat start

It should stay pure and renderer-agnostic. No Compose, no colors, no alpha, no
masking.

### InkEngine

Owns visual word policy:

- plain/upcoming/active/recited state
- whether the word participates in repeat wash
- sweep duration clamps
- shared alpha constants
- secondary gloss/transliteration fade policy
- ayah mark fade policy, if useful

It also firmly owns the *motion policy* — the tween-versus-snap rules, the
start-revealed flicker rule, repeat wash timing, feather width — because that
is where the highlight's feel actually lives. It may expose small Compose
animation helpers if that reduces reader code, but it should not become a
rendering framework.

### Renderers

Own actual text drawing:

- Arabic gloss renderer can use layered word `Text`.
- English renderer can use layered word or phrase `Text`.
- Arabic-only Hafs renderer should keep the shaped full-ayah text path and draw
  overlays/masks against that layout.

Renderers should consume `InkEngine.Word`; they should not re-derive highlight
semantics themselves.

## Options considered

### Option 1: Do nothing

Keep the current renderer-local logic.

**Pros**

- No immediate code churn.
- Existing behavior remains untouched.

**Cons**

- Polish knobs stay scattered.
- Arabic, English, and Hafs modes can drift over time.
- Reader composables keep mixing layout with highlight policy.

This is acceptable short-term, but it does not solve the tuning problem.

### Option 2: Thin InkEngine policy layer

Add `InkEngine` as a small state/policy layer between `HighlightEngine` and the
renderers.

**Pros**

- One place to tune the highlight feel.
- Keeps `HighlightEngine` pure.
- Keeps Arabic-only rendering specialized and safe.
- Low conceptual cost: `FocusEngine`, `HighlightEngine`, `InkEngine` each answer
  one question.
- Can be implemented with little code movement and little/no visual change.

**Cons**

- Adds one more named layer.
- Requires touching all reader rendering branches to pass `InkEngine.Word`.

This is the recommended approach.

### Option 3: Full InkEngine renderer

Move all animation, masking, wash drawing, and mode-specific text rendering into
one large InkEngine.

**Pros**

- Everything visually related appears to live in one place.
- The name sounds complete.

**Cons**

- Likely becomes a dense mixed-responsibility file.
- Risks hiding important Arabic-only shaping constraints.
- Encourages generic renderer abstractions that add code without improving the
  product.
- Pulls the project toward a custom text engine rabbit hole.

This is not recommended.

### Option 4: Generic renderer interface

Introduce something like `HighlightRenderer` / `InkRenderer` with separate
implementations for Arabic, English, and Hafs.

**Pros**

- Looks tidy from far away.
- Mode-specific renderers get explicit names.

**Cons**

- Adds indirection and more files.
- Does not remove the hard part: Arabic-only must draw against shaped ayah text.
- Makes simple Compose code feel framework-like.

This is not recommended unless the renderers grow much larger than they are
today.

## Recommended architecture

```text
FocusEngine
    pure / controller-backed scroll focus
    outputs ayah attention

HighlightEngine
    pure timing engine
    outputs ActiveWord timing facts

InkEngine
    reader-ui policy layer
    outputs InkEngine.Word for each word

ReaderComponents
    mode-specific layout and text drawing
    consumes InkEngine.Word

Fade.kt
    low-level draw modifiers and wash/mask primitives
```

`Fade.kt` should generally keep the draw primitives (`letterFadeIn`, shaped
bloom/mask drawing). `InkEngine` should decide what should happen; draw
modifiers should decide how to draw it.

## Implementation plan

### Step 1: Extract word ink state

Create `InkEngine.kt` and move the renderer-local word state logic into it.

Expected behavior: no visual change.

Tasks:

- Add `InkEngine.State`.
- Add `InkEngine.Word`.
- Add `InkEngine.word(...)`.
- Move active/upcoming/recited/repeat-chain derivation out of `AyahBlock`.
- Compute each ayah's word ink list once.
- Pass `InkEngine.Word` into Arabic, English, and Arabic-only branches.

### Step 2: Centralize tuning constants

Move shared visual constants and small policy functions under `InkEngine`.

Expected behavior: no intentional visual change.

Candidates:

- upcoming alpha
- full ink alpha
- min/max sweep duration
- repeat wash duration
- default repeat sweep duration
- secondary text fade
- ayah mark fade duration

Keep constants private unless another file genuinely needs them.

### Step 3: Keep drawing primitives where they belong

Leave low-level drawing in `Fade.kt` unless moving a helper clearly makes the
code shorter and easier to read.

Avoid moving all Canvas/mask code into `InkEngine.kt` just because it is
visually related.

### Step 4: Optional tests

Add JVM tests for `InkEngine.word(...)` if the extracted logic is non-trivial.

Useful cases:

- inactive ayah words are plain or upcoming according to current behavior
- active word is active
- previous words are recited
- future words are upcoming
- repeat chain marks the correct words as `repeat = true`
- high-water keeps already-recited words lit during repeat

Do not UI-test animation unless a specific regression requires it.

## Non-goals

InkEngine should not:

- replace `HighlightEngine`
- know about SQLite or timing data loading
- own scroll/focus behavior
- own Arabic shaping
- own `FlowRow` or `LazyColumn` layout
- become a custom glyph/text engine
- introduce renderer interfaces by default
- create a broad animation DSL

If implementation starts needing many files, interfaces, or renderer classes,
that is a signal to stop and simplify.

## Design principle

Unify the rule, not the renderer.

Arabic, English, and Arabic-only should share the same ink decision:

```text
Upcoming / Active / Recited / Repeat
```

But they do not need to share the same drawing mechanism. Arabic-only text has
real shaping constraints, and preserving that quality matters more than making
the code look uniformly abstract.

## Review questions

Before implementation, reviewers should answer:

1. Is `InkEngine` small enough to justify the new layer?
2. Does the proposal keep `HighlightEngine` pure?
3. Does Arabic-only keep its shaped text path?
4. Are polish knobs easier to find after this change?
5. Are we avoiding renderer interfaces and custom text-engine work until there
   is a concrete need?

If the answer to any of these is no, reduce the scope.

## As implemented

`ui/reader/InkEngine.kt` is a single object, per Option 2, with one amendment
to the proposed shape: the review found that the four-state derivation is the
easy part — the highlight's *feel* lives in the motion policy (400 ms
tween-vs-snap rules, the start-revealed flicker rule, repeat wash timing, the
1.6× feather), which was still scattered across five `remember*` helpers. So
InkEngine owns that too, as data rather than as animation code:

- **Pure policy** (JVM-tested in `InkEngineTest`):
  `wordState(position, activeWord, isActiveAyah, dimmed)` (including the
  high-water rule), `inRepeatChain(position, activeWord)`, the bundled
  `word(...) → InkEngine.Word(state, repeat)`,   `sweepMs(activeWord, speed)`
  with the min/max clamps (the min floor never exceeds the word's lit
  lifetime — stretching past handoff flickered Arabic-only's paper cover),
  `startRevealed(previous, current)` — the rule
  that only a Recited→Active transition skips the reveal sweep — and
  `prefaceState(isActive, dimmed)` / `prefaceWashProgress(positionMs, durationMs)`
  for the surah-header basmalah VectorDrawable (Active during the Al-Fatihah
  1:1 lead-in clip, with an RTL `letterFadeIn` wash paced by the clip clock and
  settled to full ink before audio ends; Upcoming while recessed; Plain at rest).
- **`InkEngine.Tuning`**: every feel knob in one data class — upcoming alpha,
  ink/mark fade durations, recess, sweep clamps, repeat sweep and fade-out,
  wash feather, and the sweep easing control points. `InkEngine.tuning` is
  snapshot-backed (`mutableStateOf`), so release builds read constants while
  the Ink Lab can retune a live session.
- **Renderers consume `InkEngine.Word`.** `AyahBlock` derives each ayah's ink
  list once and passes it into all three branches (`WordUnit`,
  `ResponsiveEnglishAyah`, `ResponsiveHafsAyah`); none of them re-derive highlight
  semantics. The Compose animation helpers stayed in ReaderComponents.kt but
  read every duration/alpha/easing from `InkEngine.tuning` — no literal
  tuning values remain in the renderers.
- **Draw primitives stayed in `ui/theme/Fade.kt`** per Step 3; the feather
  became a parameter (`letterFadeIn`/`shapedWordBloom` take `feather`) so the
  theme layer stays independent of the reader package.

### Ink Lab

Settings → Developer (triple-tap the logo) → **Ink Lab overlay** floats a
collapsible slider panel over the reader (`ui/reader/InkLabPanel.kt`), bound
directly to `InkEngine.tuning`: upcoming ink, fade timings, sweep clamps,
repeat timings, wash feather. Edits are session-only and never persisted —
shipped behavior cannot drift; **Log values** dumps the current `Tuning` to
Logcat (tag `InkLab`) so a tuned feel can be transcribed into the defaults in
InkEngine.kt.
